        <div><p>I didn't really have any challenges or troubles when completing this assignment. I read the README thoroughly and followed the steps to complete this assignemnt. From this assignment I got a review of the HTML commands and I learned how to use Git in the terminal. If I couldn't remember something that was talked about in the lecture, I would watch the Zoom lecture video that's available on Canvas.</p>
