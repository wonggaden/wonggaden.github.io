        <div><p class="entry">I didn't really have any challenges or troubles when completing this assignment. I read the README thoroughly and followed the steps to complete this assignment. From this assignment I got a review of the HTML commands and I learned how to use Git in the terminal. If I couldn't remember something that was talked about in the lecture, I would watch the Zoom lecture video that's available on Canvas.</p>

            <p class="entry"> Some challenges I faced when completing this assignment were getting the posts to wrap around to the next row. I solved this issue by realizing that I had put the code in the wrong selector. I started the assignment from top to bottom. So I started with the header, then the filter section, then the post section, then finally the buttons. When I couldn't remember how to implement a certain feature, I would go back and watch the lecture videos to see how to do it. Something I googled was the transform feature for the add-post button. The things I was stuck were really easy fixes, such as forgetting to add a ";" at the end of a line, or putting the code in the wrong selector. I found that taking breaks when I was getting stuck helped me a lot.</p>
